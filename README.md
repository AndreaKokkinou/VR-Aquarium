# Immersive VR Underwater Aquarium: An Interactive Educational Experience

## Team Members
- **Andrea Kokkinou**
- **Zoey Zheng**

## Project Overview
Our project aims to create an **interactive VR underwater aquarium** that serves both **educational and relaxation purposes**. Users will explore marine environments using intuitive swimming mechanics while learning about ocean life. Inspired by research on **VR-based relaxation techniques**, we incorporate calming visual and audio elements that respond to the environment, fostering a **therapeutic and educational experience**.

By the end of the project, we plan to develop a functional VR environment where users can:
- **Swim freely** and explore marine ecosystems
- **Interact with marine life** and experience lifelike ocean behavior
- **Access educational content** about marine biology and conservation
- **Experience a calming underwater atmosphere** with dynamic visual and audio effects

## Features & Environments
### **Tutorial Lagoon**
- A **shallow, controlled environment** to learn swimming mechanics
- Gentle **ambient sounds and soothing lighting**
- Basic **fish interactions with calm movement patterns**

### **Main Reef Environment**
- A **diverse coral reef ecosystem** with rhythmically moving marine life
- Subtle **pulsing bioluminescent elements**
- **Calming water currents** and dynamic particle effects

### **Meditation Cove**
- A **dedicated space for relaxation**
- **Slowly undulating sea plants**
- **Ambient fish schools** with hypnotic movement patterns
- **Peaceful underwater sounds** and gentle lighting

### **Educational Hub**
- A **serene central area** for accessing marine biology information
- **Calming voice-over narration** for learning
- **Conservation awareness zone** with peaceful messaging

## Technical Components & Challenges
### **Motion Control Implementation**
- Developing **gentle, fluid swimming mechanics**
- Ensuring movements promote **relaxation rather than excitement**
- Creating **smooth transitions** between areas

### **Environmental Rendering**
- Implementing **calming lighting effects** and color schemes
- Creating **subtle rhythmic movements** in the environment
- Optimizing **performance** while maintaining high visual quality

### **Relaxation Features**
- Programming **rhythmic movement patterns** for marine life
- Implementing **soothing particle effects**
- Creating **calming ambient sound systems**

## Development & Prototyping
### **Rapid Prototype**
- **Created a basic underwater environment in Unity**
- **Added 3D fishes and seashells**
- **Recorded user interactions and movement patterns**

### **Learnings from Prototype**
- Implemented **3D fish models in a 2D scene**
- Learned how **camera positioning and perspective** affect perception

### **Modifications Based on Prototype**
- **Tested swimming mechanics** using basic hand gestures
